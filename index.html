                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

                <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wp-aephotography-44126789/web/2017/08/Me-1-e1524447055100.jpg" alt="Picture of Amber"> 
                
                <p>Way back on June 13, 1985, I was born into this world two minutes after my twin sister.  I swear I have loved math and coding since.  My hometown of Armstrong, BC, couldn't offer me the options in computer technology that I seeked after graduation, so I moved to Edmonton, AB.  I completed a diploma in Computer Engineering there, then worked for Motorola in Calgary for a year.  I decided I loved software development too much to not pursue further, so I completed my Bachelor's of Computer Science degree at U of C.  I loved most of it and got a job with Shaw Communications as a Software Developer upon graduating.</p>

                <p>Life brought me all over the world, then ultimately to Salmon Arm, BC ten years ago.  I've spent the last ten years pursuing photography, growing my family, and freelancing between babies.  My work at the moment mainly consists of creating websites for non-profits, raising my children, and taking photos of families and babies for my photography business.  I enjoy reading, adventuring outside and sleeping when I have time for it.
